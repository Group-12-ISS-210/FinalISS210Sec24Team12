                <div class="container"><p> What was your experience with public K-12 education? Were you lucky enough to be one of few with the opportunity to be part of private schooling? How about a school with an adequate amount of funding? For the majority of people to say that they truly believe they received the best education possible, or yet just the average education is very unlikely. </p> Many schools in the United States are underfunded. People have not had the access to receive a good education because of this problem with underfunding. It is vital to raise school fundings. One should not have to buy their own way into receiving an education and instead schools should already have the resources necessary to permit a decent education. Schools being underfunded and private schools being inaccessible for many are some of the main reasons why decent education seems to be out of reach for many individuals. </p> Why we should care about this issue and gathered evidence: </p> Being only able to receive a better education through private schools where people have to pay for a decent education themselves is not okay: </p> “In general, the literature finds a positive impact for private schools as they are creating a higher added value given the characteristics of the pupils. However, past research generally evaluates private schools which are privately funded”(Cherchye et al., 2010). </p> Schools should not have to struggle to gain the bare minimum of funding: </p> “Financial resources for public education are increasingly scarce, and district leaders at all levels continue to struggle to maintain adequate levels of financial resources for their students and programs using complex funding formulas unique to their own jurisdictions.” (Russo et al., 2015). </p> “Just about every state high court has wrestled with school finance issues. The highest courts in many have upheld their state school finance systems; others have invalidated their school finance systems. Some states, such as New Jersey, Ohio, and Texas, experienced mul- tiple rounds of litigation during the third wave, resulting in courts both upholding and invalidating school finance systems.” (Russo et al., 2015). </p> Not to mention there is a divide on who all is accepted into private schools: </p> “At all income levels, white private school enrollment rates are greater than black and latinx private school enrollment rates. Differences in private school enrollment rates cannot be explained as a result of income differences alone. At every income level, white students are significantly more likely to be enrolled [or accepted] into private schools than are latinx or black students… The combination of income and racial enrollment patterns means that middle, upper middle, and upper class white students are substantially over-represented in private schools. In fact, over 53% of all private school students… [are] non hispanic white students from families with annual incomes over $50,000. The comparable figure in public schools is 32%” (Yun et al., 2002). </p> Studies have shown the students most affected “are students with the greatest barriers to school success, including those with low family incomes and less-educated mothers” (Figlio et al., 2021). Money plays a critical role in what education is being received. </p> Why is there a difference in funding amounts throughout schools? </p> “Fisher examined four representative states and found that nearly half of the higher education laws in this century had been enacted in the most recent two decades” (Volkwein et al., 1997). </p> “Faculty and student quality and the level of funding in our study are heavily influenced by the size of the university and the size of the state. As an influence on quality, funding is more important than flexibility, and funding is significantly associated with large size” (Volkwein et al., 1997).</p> “We find that subsidy programs created a large transfer of public funding to private schools.”  (Hungerman et al., 2016). </p> “We find that subsidy programs created a large transfer of public funding to private schools, suggesting that every dollar of funding increased revenue by a dollar or more.” (Hungerman et al., 2016). </p> Solutions: </p> More funding through scholarships: </p> The study in Florida where they used a tax-credit scholarship program for low-income students where with the extra funding they created more competitive pressure. The results where test scores improved, absenteeism and suspensions decreased  (Figlio et al., 2021) can help show that even simple scholarships can help improve educational outcomes. </p> Main solution: There needs to be higher funding given to public schools where more government policy and action needs to take place.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> </p>Kandice Sumner is a teacher of humanities for a public school in Boston, Massachusetts. She grew up in an inner city neighborhood that lacked proper funding for their school district, so she would take a one hour commute every single day to a school with better education, better resources for students, and a safer environment. She saw her friends from her neighborhood around her grow up with inadequate resources for their education, lacking school supplies and programs that would help their minds and creativity grow. She developed a “survivor's remorse” from this, guilty that she would have the privilege of such an education while those around her didn’t. She questioned to herself, “There are thousands of other kids just like me, who deserve this too… Why doesn’t everyone get this? Why is a high quality education only exclusive to the rich?”</p> Kandice now teaches in an inner city school, one that lacks proper funding for her students. She sees so much potential in every single student, but they are inevitably let down by their school’s lack of resources. Books and textbooks are limited to worn out, dated, and second hand copies, bought in rummage sales and taken from dusty attics. Her students were obviously unenthused for such poor quality books, and therefore never found a passion for reading. However, one day Kandice found online a group that donated brand new books to her class, something she had not had access to before. Suddenly, she could give students books they loved, books that sparked their interests and helped them develop. She noticed an almost instant change in her classes, with students now bringing home books, telling her how much they loved them. 
From this, Kandice reflects that through proper funding of schools, students from particularly disadvantaged areas can grow in ways they have never had their opportunity to before. This education provided to them can change everything- lower incarceration rates, better employment, and more. We can help close the “gaps” in our society through education- equal and equitable education. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>Large government and private voucher funds created large sums of money going directly to private school funds to create better, more affordable private education. The money going towards private schools from the state is being redirected straight from public school funding. This created an increase in attendance in these private schools as well as an increase in cashflow. It was found that for every dollar transferred from these funds increased the revenue of the school by more than a dollar. This means either more people enrolled in the school or the same number of students are enrolled in the school but at a higher tuition. (Laurens) Overall it can be assumed that these efforts are clearly working to increase interest in private school attendance as the revenue is increasing rapidly. The question is, what affect is this having on public school funding/quality and would everyone agree with their tax dollars contributing to private school funding?</p>

                                        <p class="mb-4"> </p>In order to retain the best education outcomes in America today, the regulations on public school funding need to increase the amount of money that schools get at the local, state, and federal levels, especially for smaller states. In a study done by James Volkwein and Shaukat Malik, they say that in their findings, “Faculty and student quality and the level of funding in our study are heavily influenced by the size of the university and the size of the state. As an influence on quality, funding is more important than flexibility, and funding is significantly associated with large size” (40; vol. 38, No. 1). When ranking states by most money spent per student in public schools, the study shows this to be true. Number one is New York (Hanson), which happens to be the fourth largest state by population (StatsAmerica). On the other hand, the bottom two states are Idaho and Utah, who rank 38th and 30th in population. The states on the lower half of population need to be given more funding for education as the difference is over $16,000 per student between the first and last states.</p>When looking at the college graduation rates of these states, the numbers also differ by a sizable amount. New York has a college graduation rate of 66%, while Idaho has a college graduation rate of 47.4%, 40th in the country (Kiersz). It is clear that the amount of funding these public schools receive from all three levels needs to be raised so that they are closer to the states bigger in population. In return, this will raise the graduation rates and increase student quality of education amongst the smaller states in America.

                                    <p class="mb-4"> </p>Studies show that less fundings can lead to less educational opportunities for students so scholarship programs are one way to incorporate more funding into the school system. There was a study in Florida that used a tax-credit scholarship program for low-income students where with the extra funding they  “construct an index of competitive pressure to measure the degree of market competition each student’s school faced prior to the program’s start”(Figlio et al., 2021). This scholarship program led to higher competition which seemed to create higher educational outcomes. They looked to see effects of the scholarship vs non scholarship students where, “non scholarship students experience negative effects, either in terms of their scores on reading and math tests or their rates of absenteeism and suspensions, based on this pre-program market pressure and the expansion of the program over time”(Figlio et al., 2021). So scores and other ratings that relate to better academic performance were compared in order to determine whether more funding like through scholarships can be beneficial within schools. </p>The study showed that with increased funding increasing competition, this led to a lower suspension and absenteeism rates along with higher test scores. The suspension rate had fell with the use of this scholarship where there was a “10 percent increase in the number of students using scholarships to attend non-public schools increases reading scores by 0.7 percent of a standard deviation and math scores by 0.3 percent of a standard deviation, as compared to schools facing less competition” (Figlio et al., 2021). Another trend being less absenteeism occurred, “the proportion of days that students were absent falls as well, by 0.03 percentage points, or 0.6 percent of the statewide average of 5 percent (Figlio et al., 2021). Lastly, test scores improved, “reading and math scores at schools in markets with more competitive pressure increase[d] by about 14.5 percent of a standard deviation by 2014, as compared to schools facing less competition” (Figlio et al., 2021). </p>But their study also found that students mostly affected “are students with the greatest barriers to school success, including those with low family incomes and less-educated mothers”(Figlio et al., 2021). This leads one to conclude that money has a very influential role in gaining the best education.  In the end, as more schools incorporated this scholarship program “academic and behavioral outcomes improved for students attending traditional public schools” and “students eligible for the program benefited most from the increased competition it created” (Figlio et al., 2021). This study can help show just to what extent the effect of more funding can have within schools. More funding through scholarship programs can lead to better school performance. If more schools implemented funding programs like a scholarship program, this could lead to a more positive number of students gaining a better education.

Not all are fortunate enough to be born into a wealthy family, and for those who can’t afford private education are their kids worse off then those who can? Evidence shows otherwise, “in general and on average, private schools are no more efficient or effective in fostering valued and measurable student outcomes than public schools” (Epple, Denis). In certain circumstances private schools may be better than public, but not all. The difficulties with funding private schools is due to its entirety. Private schools can’t compete with public schools for tax income or any public funding since they’re private education. Many have proposed allocating public education funds towards private schools but the problems arised; “ to channel public funds to private schools are unethical because they exclude society’s most vulnerable members, children from poor families, from any possibility of benefit—and furthermore, in nearly all jurisdictions they are, or would be, paid for from a revenue base that includes consumption taxes that all, even the poorest, must pay” (Epple, Denis). In an attempt to publicize private school funding we learned the tricky outcomes arise. Our mission is to increase school funding for all while maintaining potential inequalities, and with this method that can’t be achieved. </p>
